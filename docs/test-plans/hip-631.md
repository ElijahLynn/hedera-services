# HIP-631 (Account Virtual Addresses)

This HIP proposes a new concept, that of "Virtual Addresses", which bridge the conceptual gap between Hedera's and Ethereum's view of accounts and makes a step towards EVM equivalence over EVM compatibility.
To resolve the issue of account EVM compatibility and identification the proposal is to add a list of Virtual Addresses to a Hedera account that are responsible for EVM address logic.

To achieve this:

1. Hedera accounts can have a list of `evmAddress` values known as “Virtual Address” which govern the address the EVM observes for a given account transaction.
2. The Hedera network will validate ownership by extracting the public key from the signature and comparing the calculated public address to the `evmAddress` passed in on addition of the virtual address and will maintain an `evmAddress -> accountId` map thereafter.
3. Hedera Accounts can add, disable and remove virtual address entries as desired.
4. The address seen by the EVM per transaction is either the default Hedera address or a verified virtual address specified.
5. User accounts with a simple `ECDSA` key will be migrated to accounts with a single virtual address.
6. Developers can utilize `HAPI` to specify EVM address overrides and retrieve account virtual address information.
7. Users with non-simple `ECDSA` keys can utilize any `evmAddress` matching `ECDSA` key in their wallets when interacting with smart contracts to be `ECRECOVER` compatible. In some cases they may be able to authorize transaction submission.
8. Users can optionally update their simple account key structure to support signing of transactions using the matching ECDSA key pair that maps to an `evmAddress` added.
9. Contract accounts may utilize the `evmAddress` to store their address in accordance with `CREATE` and `CREATE2` EVM operations

## Scope

This feature effects,
- **HAPI**: `CryptoCreate`, `CryptoTransfer`, `EthereumTransaction`, `CryptoUpdate`, `ContractCreate` and `ContractCall`

So the high-level scope includes:
1. Positive functional tests, which test the updated `CryptoCreate` and `CryptoTransfer` transactions with different types of keys, aliases and EVM addresses.
2. Positive functional tests, which test the updated `ContractCreate` and `ContractCall` transactions that resolve EVM addresses based on virtual address override or default virtual address.
3. Positive functional tests, which test the updated `CryptoUpdate` transaction to modify account's virtual addresses.
4. Negative functional tests, which test failure scenarios of updated `CryptoUpdate` transactions.
5. State validation for all these positive and negative tests.

## Methodology

Tests needed to cover the above scope.

:white_check_mark:&nbsp;**Positive functional** testing will require EET specs
that perform all variants of `CryptoCreate` and `CryptoTransfer` with different type of keys, aliases and EVM addresses and test if the new account is created
appropriately.

:white_check_mark:&nbsp;**Positive functional** testing will require EET specs
that perform all variants of `ContractCreate` and `ContractCall` with different type EVM address resolution (e.g. based on override or default virtual address) and test if the determined EVM address is correct.

:white_check_mark:&nbsp;**Positive functional** testing will require EET specs
that perform all variants of `CryptoUpdate` with different type of virtual address operations (e.g. add, disable, remove or update) and test if the resulting account is updated appropriately.

:x:&nbsp;**Negative functional** testing will require EET specs that perform all
variants of `CryptoUpdate` transactions with different type of virtual address operations do not succeed.

:sparkle:&nbsp;**State validation** will require a new assert built-in for the EET `HapiGetAccountInfo` query, to assert the virtual addresses of the account. Given this, the above functional tests can be easily enhanced to validate state is changed (or unchanged) as appropriate.

**Migration** testing will require EET specs that perform
state migration with all possible variants of `virtualAddresses.migrate` flags for state containing different entity types
and verifying the final state has entities with single virtual address that is set as a default.

## Phase 1
### :white_check_mark: Positive functional
- Testing changes in this phase will be with more focus on unit tests

### :x: Negative functional
- Any transaction using an `evmAddress` that is in the not-allowed list should fail

## Phase 2
### Migration tests
- Aliased accounts migration
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for account with `ECDSA key alias` should:
    - Add a single virtual address to the account's virtual addresses list with value equal to the `evmAddress` derived from the `ECDSA key alias`
    - Set the virtual address to be the default one
    - Set the virtual address nonce to be equal to the `ethereum_nonce` of the account
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for hollow account:
    - Add a single virtual address to the account's virtual addresses list with value equal to the `evmAddress alias` of the hollow account
    - Set the virtual address to be the default one
    - Set the virtual address nonce to be equal to the `ethereum_nonce` of the account
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for account with `ED key alias` should be a no-op
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for account without an alias should be a no-op 
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for contract should be a no-op 
- ECDSA accounts migration (given that aliased accounts migration was run)
  - Performing ECDSA accounts migration for account with simple `ECDSA key` should:
    - Add a single virtual address to the account's virtual addresses list with value equal to the `evmAddress` derived from the `ECDSA key`
    - Set the virtual address to be the default one
    - Set the virtual address nonce to be equal to the `ethereum_nonce` of the account
  - Performing ECDSA accounts migration for account with simple `ED key` or any non-simple key should be a no-op
  - Performing ECDSA accounts migration for hollow account should be a no-op
  - Performing aliased accounts migration for contract should be a no-op 
- Contracts migration
  - Performing contract migration for contract with `evmAddress alias` should:
    - Add a single virtual address to the contract account's virtual addresses list with value equal to the `evmAddress alias` of the contract 
    - Set the virtual address to be the default one
    - Set the virtual address nonce to be equal to the `ethereum_nonce` of the account
  - Performing contract migration for contract with `non-evmAddress alias` or empty `alias` should be a no-op
  - Performing contract migration for accounts should be a no-op

### :white_check_mark: Positive functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.add.address` for an existing account should add a new virtual address, if `virtual_address_update.add.is_default` is set to `true` the added address should become the default virtual address
- `CryptoCreate` with `ECDSA key` should create an account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoCreate` with `ECDSA key alias` should create an account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoCreate` with `evmAddress alias` should create an account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoCreate` with `evmAddress` should create a hollow account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoTransfer` with `ECDSA key alias` to a non-existing account should auto-create an account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoTransfer` with `evmAddress alias` to a non-existing account should auto-create an account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `CryptoTransfer` with `evmAddress` to a non-existing account should lazy-create a hollow account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `EthereumTransaction` to a non-existing account with `tx.to` EVM address value should lazy-create a hollow account with single virtual address and make it the default virtual address
- `ContractCreate/ContractCall` resulting in creation of a new contract should add the CREATE/CREATE2 EVM address value to `contract.account.virtualAddresses`
- `CryptoGetInfoQuery` for an existing account should return the virtual addresses list for the account

### :x: Negative functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.add.address` for an existing account should fail if the account already has a virtual address
- `CryptoCreate` with `evmAddress alias` should fail if the `evmAddress` value is being used as a virtual address for an account
- `CryptoCreate` with `evmAddress` should fail if the `evmAddress` value is being used as a virtual address for an account

## Phase 3
### :white_check_mark: Positive functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.add.address` for an existing account should successfully add a new virtual address for up to 3 virtual addresses per account
- `ContractCreate/ContractCall` for an account with a default virtual address should use that address in the EVM
- `ContractCreate/ContractCall` with `virtual_address_override` address value should use that address in the EVM
- Virtual address update for a contracts should fail, ensuring contract accounts immutability

### :x: Negative functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.add.address` for an existing account should fail if the account already has 3 virtual addresses
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.update.address` for an existing account should fail if the account's virtual addresses list does not contain the `virtual_address_update.update.address`

## Phase 4
### :white_check_mark: Positive functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.disable` value that is present in the virtual address list for an existing account should disable the virtual address

### :x: Negative functional
- `CryptoUpdate` with `virtual_address_update.disable` value that matches the default virtual address should fail
